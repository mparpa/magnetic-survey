%README:
%   Script for automatizing magnetic surveys on grids.
%   It produces a file.txt in which all the data are saved and it
%   also post-processes the results by displaying a contour figure. For
%   each element of the grid it must be taken 4 measures positioning the
%   instrument at 0째, 45째, 90째 and 135째 with respect to the ground surface.
%   The post-processing considers an average of all these measures in each
%   element of the grid.
%
%   The user is prompted to insert the size of the grid (rows and columns)
%   and the filename.txt to save all the registered data into.
%   Once the configuration part ends the user can start taking measures,
%   with the possibility of accepting or rejecting the results
%   (for instance if the instruments was not correctly placed). In all the
%   cases the default answer is YES (this means that to enter yes it is
%   just needed to press ENTER).
%
%   At the beginning of the code there is the possibility to set a variable
%   ICODE = 0 or = 1. IF = 0, the script produces only the value L without
%   any saving or post processing. IF = 1, the script does all the above
%   mentioned actions.
%
% The script requires the following functions (devel. by Texas Instrument):
%       - SFRC_Sensor_FUN.m : this was previosly the main used to interact
%       with LDC1000 instrument (LDC1000_Script.m). The main was converted 
%       into a function.
%
%       - Open and Close Serial Port:
%           -- LDC1000_open.m
%           -- LDC1000_close.m
%
%       - Stream Data:
%           -- LDC1000_setsamplerate.m
%           -- LDC1000_startstream.m
%           -- LDC1000_stopstream.m
%           -- LDC1000_streamdata.m
%
%       - Read / Write Registers:
%           -- LDC1000_readreg.m
%           -- LDC1000_writereg.m
%
%       - Misc:
%           -- LDC1000_version.m
